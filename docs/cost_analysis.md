# Legal RAG System Cost Analysis

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with deploying and operating the Legal RAG System at different scales. Use this information for budgeting and optimization decisions.

## Vector Database Costs (Pinecone)

| Tier | Monthly Price | Storage Capacity | QPS Limit | Suitable For |
|------|--------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Starter | $0 (Free) | 100K vectors | 1-20 | POC/Development |
| Standard S1 | $80/month | 1M vectors | 100 | Small deployment |
| Standard S2 | $160/month | 2M vectors | 200 | Medium deployment |
| Enterprise | Custom pricing | Unlimited | Custom | Large-scale production |

### Breakdown of Pinecone Costs

- **Storage Cost**: ~$0.08 per 1,000 vectors per month
- **Query Cost**: Included in monthly pricing (based on QPS limits)
- **Dimension Impact**: Higher dimensions (768, 1536) increase storage requirements
- **Index Type**: Approximate (ANN) vs Exact indexing affects cost and performance

### Estimated Monthly Costs By Document Volume

| Enterprise | 100,000+ | 4K tokens | GPT-4 | $5,000-10,000+ |

*Note: Costs are higher with GPT-4 (~20x) but may provide better quality for complex legal questions.

## Infrastructure Costs

| Medium Production | 8 vCPU | 16 GB | $160-240 |
| Large Production | 16+ vCPU | 32+ GB | $320-1,000+ |

### Containerization and Orchestration

| Service | Scale | Monthly Cost Estimate |
|---------|-------|----------------------|
| Docker (Self-hosted) | Any | $0 (infrastructure costs only) |
| Kubernetes (Self-hosted) | Small | $200-500 |
| Kubernetes (Self-hosted) | Medium | $500-1,500 |
| Kubernetes (Managed) | Small | $300-700 |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Caching Impact

| Cache Type | Hit Rate | API Cost Reduction | Example Savings |
|------------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Result Cache | 30% | 30% | $300 → $210/month |
| Result Cache | 50% | 50% | $300 → $150/month |
| Embedding Cache | 80% | 80% of embedding costs | $100 → $20/month |

### Batch Processing Benefits

| Processing Type | Single Requests | Batched Requests | Cost Savings |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Embedding Generation | $0.0001/1K tokens | $0.0001/1K tokens (but fewer API calls) | 10-30% |
| LLM Processing | Base rate | Potentially lower per-token rate with batching | 5-15% |

### Token Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Impact | Savings Example |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Chunk Size Optimization | 20-30% fewer tokens | $500 → $350-400/month |
| Context Pruning | 10-20% fewer tokens | $500 → $400-450/month |
| Response Length Control | 15-25% fewer output tokens | Varies by usage pattern |
| Model Selection | Using GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4 where appropriate | Up to 95% savings |

## Long-term Cost Planning

As your legal RAG system scales, consider these strategies for managing costs:

1. **Tiered Access**: Offer different service levels with varying context lengths and models
2. **Hybrid Approach**: Use cheaper models for initial processing, premium models for complex queries
3. **Fine-tuning**: Consider fine-tuning models for specialized legal domains (one-time cost, long-term savings)
4. **Self-hosting**: At very large scale, explore self-hosted embedding models

## ROI Calculation

| Benefit | Impact | Value |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Time Savings | 75% reduction in legal research time | ~$200-300/hour of lawyer time |
| Accuracy Improvement | 40% better answers | Reduced risk, better outcomes |
| Concurrent Usage | Support for 500+ users | Scale without additional staff |
| Response Time | Sub-2-second responses | Improved user experience |

For a medium-sized legal practice with 20 attorneys, each saving 10 hours/month on research:
- Monthly cost of RAG system: ~$1,000-3,000
- Monthly time savings: 200 hours × $250/hour = $50,000
- **ROI**: ~20x
